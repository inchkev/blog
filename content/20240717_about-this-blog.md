Men will really do anything but write. Two months ago I wanted to start a blog to have a writing practice. I would start small. Write about things I did over the weekend or about the state of my basil plants out back. I’d slowly get more comfortable with writing longer, more eloquently. But instead of doing that I have sporadically spent the last two months building this website. What you see here is completely from-scratch. The site generator is written in Rust. It’s basic but it does exactly what it needs to. It parses markdown files, understands jinja templates, and it can syntax highlight. And I can finally write now.
