I will really do anything but write. Two months ago I wanted to start a blog to practice writing. I would start small. Write about things I did over the weekend or about the state of my basil plants out back. I’d slowly get more comfortable with writing longer. But instead of doing that, I’ve sporadically spent the past two months building this website. What you see here is built from scratch because I’m stubborn and refuse to use a static site generator (or learn modern web development). I wrote the site generator in Rust. It parses markdown files, understands jinja templates, and it can syntax highlight. It’s simple and it does exactly what I want it to. And I can finally write now.
